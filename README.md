# Free Dev Resources

## What this is

Heavily inspired by <https://github.com/ripienaar/free-for-dev> with a focus on resources that are entirely free and without limitations. I wasn't quite happy with a lot of the limitations put on some of the free resources, so I've done my best to compile a list of resources with the most permissive licenses. The table will also outline what the license is and whether there is a barrier to get it such as signing up or providing an email address.

**Disclaimer:** Views expressed here are not legal advice and I suggest reading the licenses as it pertains to your situation. Licenses can change and while I've done my best to interpret the licenses, I am not a lawyer. Additionally, I've done my best to find and interpret licenses at the time of writing, but as licenses can change they may not be 100% accurate. Please read the license before using these assets.

## What this is not

This is not a list of services offering free tiers with limitations, generous or otherwise. I will list some services offering free tiers but only if they are free without restriction. For services with free tiers, the previously linked [free-for-dev](https://github.com/ripienaar/free-for-dev) repository is more appropriate.

It is also not an exhaustive list of free software.

## Requirement for dev resources
* Must be freely usable for open and closed source projects (simply being free for open source won't make the list).
* For customer-facing resources (such as images, videos, and fonts) any attribution requirement should be minimal and not require it to be declared in customer-facing content.
